# Images-classification

The Herbarium 2022: Flora of North America dataset is part of a National Science Foundation-funded New York Botanical Garden project to build tools to identify new plant species around the world. The dataset aims to represent all known vascular plant taxa in North America using images collected from 60 different botanical institutions around the world.
The Herbarium 2022: Flora of North America dataset https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/herbarium-2022-fgvc9/data contains 1.05 million images of 15,500 vascular plants that make up over 90% of the taxa documented in North America . The Vascular Plants of America (VPA) checklist prepared by the Missouri Botanical Gardens was used. The dataset is limited to include only vascular terrestrial plants (lycopods, ferns, gymnosperms, and flowering plants).
It is necessary to build a classifier of images of vascular plants. Quality assessment is performed using F1_macro, moreover, F1_macro > 0.8.
